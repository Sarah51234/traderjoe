            <a href ="https://www.traderjoes.com/home" target ="_blank">Trader Joe's</a> is an American grocery store chain headquartered in Monrovia, California, with 597 locations across the US.[3]

            The first Trader Joe's store was opened in 1967 by founder Joe Coulombe in Pasadena, California.[4][5] In 1979, the chain was sold to Aldi founder Theo Albrecht,[6] who owned it until his death in 2010; ownership passed to his heirs.[7] The company operates offices in both Monrovia, California, and Boston, Massachusetts but remains German owned.[8]
